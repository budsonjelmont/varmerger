Test#	Description	Result
test 1	two alleles of single position merging w/ third SNP	Merges but one allele is omitted (no GROUP_IN value)
test 2	incompatible VCFs	No merge
test 3	mergeable adjacent insertion & deletion	Correct merge	
test 4	mergeable adjacent insertions	Correct merge
test 5	variants on different chromosomes	No merge
test 6	deletions of various lengths starting at same position	No merge
test 7	overlapping deletions, inconsistent descriptions	No merge	
test 8	overlapping deletions, not anchored	No merge
test 9	SNP + delins	Test positions are wrong, result is wrong--come back to this
test 10	Two deletions very far away	Merges (I assume correctly)
test 11	Variant with dot notation	Throws error
test 12	5 variant types	Merges (I assume correctly)
test 13	SNP with incorrect reference sequence	Merges, repeat this w/ easier test case
test 14	Insertion overlapping another variant	Merges correctly	
test 15	Insertion overlapping another variant	Merges correctly (identical to test 15)
test 16	Inversion overlapping another variant, inconsistent description	No merge	
test 17 No merge required, merged variant already present	No merge	
test 18 No merge required, single variant in VCF	No merge
