Test#	Description	Result
test 1	two alleles of single position merging w/ third SNP	Merges but one allele is omitted (no GROUP_IN value)
test 2	incompatible VCFs	No merge
test 3	mergeable adjacent insertion & deletion	Correct merge	
test 4	mergeable adjacent insertions	Correct merge
test 5	variants on different chromosomes	No merge
test 6	deletions of various lengths starting at same position	No merge, only first variant is retained
test 7	overlapping deletions, inconsistent descriptions	No merge, only first variant is retained	
test 8	overlapping deletions, not anchored	No merge
test 9	SNP + delins	Test positions are wrong, result is wrong--come back to this
test 10	Two deletions very far away	Merges (I assume correctly)
test 11	Variant with dot notation	Merges, . replaced with REF allele before VCF conversion	make_test_jsons writes incorrect payload, need to manually correct	
test 12	6 variant types	Merges, one variant skipped
test 13	SNP with incorrect reference sequence	Merges, incorrect REF ignored
test 14	Insertion overlapping another variant	Merges correctly	
test 15	Insertion overlapping another variant	Merges correctly (identical to test 15)
test 16	Inversion overlapping another variant, inconsistent description	No merge	
test 17 No merge required, merged variant already present	No merge	
test 18 No merge required, single variant in VCF	No merge
test 19 Del + SNPs + Inv	Merge (normalized deletions)
test 20 Del + SNPs + Inv	Merge (non-normalized deletions) 
test 21 Del + SNPs + Inv	Merge (SNP2 skipped w/ warning b/c it conflicts w/ previous entry) 
test 22 Del + SNPs + Inv	Merge (Same as 21 but SNP2 not skipped b/c previous entry is normalized) 
test 23 Del + DelIns + SNPs + Inv	Merge (DELINS1 skipped w/ warning) 
test 24 SNPs + Del	SNP occurs after 3bp Deletion	PASS
test 25 Del + SNPs + Inv	Merge (same as 19 but first deletion is not normalized--incorrect merge) FAIL
test 26 3SNPs + Inv	First SNP NOT normalized	PASS	
test 27 Delins + SNP	SNP overlapping delins that is consistent	Second variant skipped
test 28 2 overlapping Delins	Overlapping delins that are consistent Second variant skipped	


TODO repeat 7 but with another variant further downstream
